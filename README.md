# ICKIE NUMERALS

A convoluted way of converting numbers to roman numerals. Bash scripts drive a C-program that outputs numbers
in INTERCAL input format which is converted to Roman numerals by a receiving INTERCAL-program. A better use-case
for INTERCAL is hard to come by. No circuitous diagram needed.

## Run environment
* A computer with some INTERCAL (tested on C-INTERCAL) for INTERCAL
* GCC for C
* Bash of course for Bash
* BATS (core, support and assert) or tests will explode
* Hint: Use Visual Studio Code and Dev Containers for a complete environment

## How to use
1. Run `ickie_numerals.sh <number>`
2. Success!

## How to test
1. Run `test.sh`
2. Great success!
